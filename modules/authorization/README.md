# BigQuery Authorized Views

This submodule is used to add [authorized views](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/share-access-views#authorize_the_view_to_access_the_source_dataset).
The views that are created at another dataset are given readonly access so that even if the user does not have read access to the real dataset,
they can read data over the view.

## Background
It is possible to define authorized views while creating a dataset. However, we have a chicken&egg problem if we create all at the same time. This module has the goal of solving that.
See [basic_view](../../examples/basic_view/main.tf) as an example.

## Caveat
This module creates [bigquery_dataset_access](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/bigquery_dataset_access.html) resources, which conflict with the
access blocks in a [bigquery_dataset](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/bigquery_dataset.html) resource. Therefore, when using together with a dataset,
you should pass empty access block to the dataset.


Example:
```hcl
module "dataset" {
  source = "terraform-google-modules/bigquery/google"
  version = "~> 5.4"

  dataset_id                  = "example_dataset"
  dataset_name                = "example_dataset"
  description                 = "example description"
  project_id                  = "example-project"
  location                    = "US"

  access = [] # pass empty not to conflict with below
}

module "add_authorization" {
  source = "terraform-google-modules/bigquery/google//modules/authorization"
  version = "~> 4.1"

  dataset_id = module.dataset.bigquery_dataset.dataset_id
  project_id = module.dataset.bigquery_dataset.project

  roles = [
    {
      role           = "roles/bigquery.dataEditor"
      group_by_email = "ops@mycompany.com"
    }
  ]

  authorized_views = [
    {
      project_id = "view_project"
      dataset_id = "view_dataset"
      table_id   = "view_id"
    }
  ]
  authorized_datasets = [
    {
      project_id = "auth_dataset_project"
      dataset_id = "auth_dataset"
    }
  ]
}
```
