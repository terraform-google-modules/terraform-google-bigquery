# terraform-google-bigquery

This module allows you to create opinionated Google Cloud Platform BigQuery datasets and tables.
This will allow the user to programmatically create an empty table schema inside of a dataset, ready for loading.
Additional user accounts and permissions are necessary to begin querying the newly created table(s).

## Compatibility
This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.13. If you haven't
[upgraded](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-13.html) and need a Terraform
0.12.x-compatible version of this module, the last released version
intended for Terraform 0.12.x is [v4.5.0](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/-bigquery/google/v4.5.0).

## Upgrading

The current version is 4.X. The following guides are available to assist with upgrades:

- [3.0 -> 4.0](./docs/upgrading_to_bigquery_v4.0.md)
- [2.0 -> 3.0](./docs/upgrading_to_bigquery_v3.0.md)
- [1.0 -> 2.0](./docs/upgrading_to_bigquery_v2.0.md)
- [0.1 -> 1.0](./docs/upgrading_to_bigquery_v1.0.md)

### Variable `tables` detailed description

The `tables` variable should be provided as a list of object with the following keys:
```hcl
{
  table_id = "some_id"                        # Unique table id (will be used as ID and Freandly name for the table).
  schema = "path/to/schema.json"              # Path to the schema json file.
  time_partitioning = {                       # Set it to `null` to omit partitioning configuration for the table.
        type                     = "DAY",     # The only type supported is DAY, which will generate one partition per day based on data loading time.
        field                    = null,      # The field used to determine how to create a time-based partition. If time-based partitioning is enabled without this value, the table is partitioned based on the load time. Set it to `null` to omit configuration.
        require_partition_filter = false,     # If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified. Set it to `null` to omit configuration.
        expiration_ms            = null,      # Number of milliseconds for which to keep the storage for a partition.
      },
  range_partitioning = {                      # Set it to `null` to omit partitioning configuration for the table.
    field = "integer_column",                 # The column used to create the integer range partitions.
    range = {
      start    = "1"                          # The start of range partitioning, inclusive.
      end      = "100",                       # The end of range partitioning, exclusive.
      interval = "10",                        # The width of each range within the partition.
        },
      },
  clustering = ["fullVisitorId", "visitId"]   # Specifies column names to use for data clustering. Up to four top-level columns are allowed, and should be specified in descending priority order. Partitioning should be configured in order to use clustering.
  expiration_time = 2524604400000             # The time when this table expires, in milliseconds since the epoch. If set to `null`, the table will persist indefinitely.
  labels = {                                  # A mapping of labels to assign to the table.
      env      = "dev"
      billable = "true"
    }
}
```

### Variable `views` detailed description

The `views` variable should be provided as a list of object with the following keys:
```hcl
{
  view_id = "some_id"                                                # Unique view id. it will be set to friendly name as well
  query = "Select user_id, name from `project_id.dataset_id.table`"  # the Select query that will create the view. Tables should be created before.
  use_legacy_sql = false                                             # whether to use legacy sql or standard sql
  labels = {                                                         # A mapping of labels to assign to the view.
      env      = "dev"
      billable = "true"
  }
}
```

### Variable `routines` detailed description

The `routines` variable should be provided as a list of object with the following keys:
```hcl
{
  routine_id = "some_id"                     # The ID of the the routine. The ID must contain only letters, numbers, or underscores. The maximum length is 256 characters.
  routine_type = "PROCEDURE"                 # The type of routine. Possible values are SCALAR_FUNCTION and PROCEDURE.
  routine_language = "SQL"                   # The language of the routine. Possible values are SQL and JAVASCRIPT.
  definition_body = "CREATE FUNCTION test return x*y;"  # The body of the routine. For functions, this is the expression in the AS clause. If language=SQL, it is the substring inside (but excluding) the parentheses.
  return_type     = null                     # A JSON schema for the return type. Optional if language = "SQL"; required otherwise. If absent, the return type is inferred from definitionBody at query time in each query that references this routine. If present, then the evaluated result will be cast to the specified returned type at query time.
  routine_description = "Description"       # The description of the routine if defined.
  arguments = [                             # Set it to `null` to omit arguments block configuration for the routine.
    {
      name      = "x",                      # The name of this argument. Can be absent for function return argument.
      data_type = null,                     # A JSON schema for the data type. Required unless argumentKind = ANY_TYPE.
      argument_kind = "ANY_TYPE"            # Defaults to FIXED_TYPE. Default value is FIXED_TYPE. Possible values are FIXED_TYPE and ANY_TYPE.
      mode = null                           # Specifies whether the argument is input or output. Can be set for procedures only. Possible values are IN, OUT, and INOUT.
    }
  ]
}
